# INSOLUBILITY-PREDICTOR

Insolubilty-Predictor is a project focused mainly on checking the insolubilty of chemicals on water.Generally chemicals or drugs are so expensive to make and testing in water takes time also outcome is not predictable and also risky .So I made insolubilty predictor to check the solubilty of drugs using their molecular strings.From the molecular strings we will extract all chemicals features and predict whether soluable or not.

## Features
Solubilty or Insolubilty prediction.
RandomForest regressor with 80% accuracy
Simple and interactive UI
Mainly aimed for Pharmeutical suites
